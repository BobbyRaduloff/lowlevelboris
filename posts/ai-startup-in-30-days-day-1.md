# Introduction
In the current tech climate, not a day goes by without some big news about AI breaking.
Whether it's another way in which OpenAI are disrupting the entire industry or Stable Diffusion going to court,
everyone is extremely invested in this new AI boom.

My favourite group of online opportunits (it's a compliment) have picked it up as well.
YouTube and TikTok are flooded with everyone from dropshipper nobodies to Alex Hormozi
teaching people how easy it is to make a living with AI.

I want to see if they're right.

# The Plan
However, instead of following the already conventional advice of using ChatGPT to
write my cold-emails or to set up my Shopify copy, I'm going to play to my strengths.
I want to build a mobile app that, preferrably, utilizes an already existing AI model
to tap into a new market. That's why me and my partner [Nick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitev-nikolay/)
came up with Nutshell.

Nutshell is (will be) an AI-powerd email client aimed at the white collar class.
We'll aim to build an MVP in 30 days that we can then launch primarily on the Apple App Store.
For this early version, we want to focus on a client that summarizes your emails with AI and saves you time.

# Why?
Because time is money. For the sake of argument, let's say an analyst at an investment bank
spends 30 minutes a day reading emails (its probably more than that).
Their average salary with all comp and bonuses is about $200k a year or $100 an hour.
Let's say we can cut this time in half. That's $25 dollars a day or $500 a month in saved time.

It's the perfect gig according to the exact people that inspired this challenge.
- It's easy to implement and to scale.
- Sales are not limited by how many people I can cold call.
- The perceived value is very high.
- The target audience has tremendous spending power.

What can go wrong?

# A bit on the tech
Now, it's important to mention that it's absolutely not worth it to build my own AI to do this.
Thankfully, an older version of the tech behind ChatGPT called GPT3 is available as a fairly cheaply priced API.
All I need to build is a backend that can enter an IMAP mailbox and scrape the unread emails,
a module that calls the GPT3 API, and a React Native app.

I've chosen this tech stack mostly because of how fast it will allow me to develop the app.
In terms of design, Nick is an absolute DaVinci at the Figma (stay tuned for his work).

# Conclusion
I plan to post updates on this daily on my blog here and on my [TikTok channel](https://tiktok.com/@lowlevelboris).
